Roof & Bed is an AirBnb clone where different users can rent or put for rent flats.
A user can book a flat in selected start_date and end_date or add flats to rent.

You can check it out running at [roof-and-bed.herokuapp.com](http://roof-and-bed.herokuapp.com/).

## About the Code

It's a **fully responsive** app using **Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Active Record and MapBox API**. All CRUD actions are possible depending on the user, so Pundit give us the control needed.
The user can see all flats that have been rented in the next trips and in the past ones, so as all flats they put available for renting, through a Dashboard.
